1) Fix rsyncwrapper thread. Sometimes it doesn't send all the output 
   to the QTextEdit in rsyncwidget.

2) Make qtrsync save sessions.

3) Fix archive mode. When archive mode is enabled and then disabled, 
   recursive checkbox change its state to unchecked. It forgets its old state.

4) Users should be able to give more advanced options, like all the options described in rsync's manual.

5) Do more testing
