Installing QtRsync is simple.
First, make sure you have installed rsync, then in a terminal type

qmake-qt4
make
make install (you need root permissions)

these commands must be executed in the directory where you have extracted 
QtRsync. For example, you have extracted the tarball in your home directory
then switch to the directory just created typing:

cd path_to_the_new_directory

then you can type the commands above.
